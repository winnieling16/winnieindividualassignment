				<h1>My 
				<br>
				Blender Portfolio</h1>
				<hr>	
				<p>Welcome to my Blender portfolio! As a beginner-to-intermediate 3D artist, I am excited to share my journey of exploring Blenderâ€™s creative possibilities. This collection features some of my recent projects that highlight my growing skills and enthusiasm for 3D modeling and design.
				
				The first project is a cozy room design that showcases a bright blue wardrobe, an orange bed with colorful pillows, and a neat study desk complete with books, a lamp, and a yellow chair. Personal touches, such as a Winnie the Pooh poster, family photos, and a trophy on the shelf, bring life and character to the scene. This project allowed me to practice basic modeling, arranging elements in a scene, and experimenting with lighting techniques to create a warm and inviting space.
			
				The second project features a festive robot character, designed with a holiday theme. From the front view, the robot wears a shiny Santa hat and a bright red scarf, reflecting light with its metallic surfaces. The back view reveals a colorful backpack adorned with glowing lights, a candy cane design, and a shining star. Through this project, I explored materials, textures, glowing effects, and vibrant colors, showcasing my ability to balance creativity and technical skills. Each of these projects reflects my progress as I continue to learn and create in Blender.
