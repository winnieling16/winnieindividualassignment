				<p>Hello! My name is Winnie Ling Qiao Qin, and I’m a dedicated student with a passion for web development and design. I enjoy discovering delicious food and drinks, sharing fun stories with friends, and embracing a relaxed, chill vibe, especially when napping under warm weather. Known for my collaborative spirit, hard-working attitude, and punctuality, I have successfully designed a personal portfolio website and led a team project, which honed my problem-solving and teamwork skills. As someone who believes in persistence and never giving up, I’m excited to explore a future in web development, where creativity and determination go hand in hand. Welcome to my personal page!</p>
